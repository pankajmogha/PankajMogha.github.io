Hello! I’m Dr. Pankaj Mogha — a researcher passionate about integrating cutting-edge single-cell technologies with organ-on-chip platforms to explore stem cell biology, tissue engineering, and epitranscriptomics.

I earned my BTech in Biotechnology in India, followed by a Master’s degree in Biotechnology from QUT Brisbane. I completed my PhD in Chemical Engineering at IIT Bombay in 2021, where I focused on mechanobiology and the maintenance of primary stem cells.

Currently, I’m a postdoctoral scholar at UC Santa Barbara, working at the intersection of single-cell transcriptomics. Before UCSB, I completed a postdoc at Duke University, where I worked towards the development of vascularized lung-on-chip and nociception-on-chip models.

My research vision centers on building physiologically relevant in vitro models to decode cellular decision-making in development and disease with a special emphasis on applying spatial transcriptomics and RNA modifications to understand cellular heterogeneity.

#Soon, I will be joining as an Assistant Professor, alongside my spouse, as we both take the next step in our academic careers and establish our long-term home in a vibrant research community.

Outside of the lab, I’m passionate about mentoring young scientists, building collaborative networks, and translating science into solutions that matter.
