Hello! I’m Dr. Pankaj Mogha — a researcher passionate about integrating cutting-edge single-cell technologies with organ-on-chip platforms to explore stem cell biology, tissue engineering, and epitranscriptomics.

I earned my BTech in Biotechnology in India, followed by a Master’s degree in Biotechnology from QUT Brisbane. I completed my PhD in Chemical Engineering at IIT Bombay in 2021, where I focused on mechanobiology and the maintenance of primary stem cells.

Currently, I’m a postdoctoral scholar at UC Santa Barbara, working at the intersection of single-cell transcriptomics. Before UCSB, I completed a postdoc at Duke University, where I worked towards the development of vascularized lung-on-chip and nociception-on-chip models.

My research vision centers on building physiologically relevant in vitro models to decode cellular decision-making in development and disease with a special emphasis on applying spatial transcriptomics and RNA modifications to understand cellular heterogeneity.

Outside of the lab, I’m passionate about mentoring young scientists, building collaborative networks, and translating science into solutions that matter.
