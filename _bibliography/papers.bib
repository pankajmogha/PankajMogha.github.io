	abstract = {Cell–cell interaction via substrate deformation in turn modifies cellular response to substrate rigidity.  The effect of substrate stiffness on the cellular morphology, proliferation, and differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) has been extensively researched and well established. However, the majority of these studies are done with a low seeding density where cell to cell interactions do not play a significant role. While these conditions permit an analysis of cell–substratum interactions at the single cell level, such a model system fails to capture a critical aspect of the cellular micro-environment in vivo , i.e. the cell–cell interaction via matrix deformation ( i.e. , strain). To address this question, we seeded hMSCs on soft poly-acrylamide (PAA) gels, at a seeding density that permits cells to be mechanically interacting via the underlying substrate. We found that as the intercellular distance decreases with the increasing seeding density, cellular sensitivity towards the substrate rigidity becomes significantly diminished. With the increasing seeding density, the cell spread area increased on a soft substrate (500 Pa) but reduced on an even slightly stiffer substrate (2 kPa) as well as on glass making them indistinguishable at a high seeding density. Not only in terms of cell spread area but also at a high seeding density, cells formed mature focal adhesions and prominent stress fibres on a soft substrate similar to that of the cells being cultured on a stiff substrate. The decreased intercellular distance also influenced the proliferation rate of the cells: higher seeding density on the soft substrate showed cell cycle progression similar to that of the cells on glass substrates. In summary, this paper demonstrates how the effect of substrate rigidity on the cell morphology and fate is a function of inter-cellular distance when seeded on a soft substrate. Our AFM data suggest that such changes happen due to local strain stiffening of the soft PAA gel, an effect that has been rarely reported in the literature so far.},

	abstract = {Microbial lipids play a critical role in the pathogenesis of infectious diseases by modulating the host cell membrane properties, including lipid/protein diffusion and membrane organization. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) synthesizes various chemically distinct lipids that are exposed on its outer membrane and interact with host cell membranes. However, the effects of the structurally diverse Mtb lipids on the host cell membrane properties to fine-tune the host cellular response remain unknown. In this study, we employed membrane biophysics and cell biology to assess the effects of different Mtb lipids on cell membrane mechanics, lipid diffusion, and the cytoskeleton of THP-1 macrophages. We found that Mtb lipids modulate macrophage membrane properties, actin cytoskeleton, and biochemical processes, such as protein phosphorylation and lipid peroxidation, in a virulence lipid-selective manner. These results emphasize that Mtb can fine-tune its interactions with the host cells governed by modulating the lipid profile on its surface. These observations provide a novel lipid-centric paradigm of Mtb pathogenesis that is amenable to pharmacological inhibition and could promote the development of robust biomarkers of Mtb infection and pathogenesis.},

Although freshly isolated HPKs exhibit a robust regenerative capacity, traditional methodology fails to provide a sufficient number of cells. Here we demonstrated a well characterized, non-cytotoxic and inert hydrogel as a substrate that mimics skin elasticity, which can accelerate proliferation and generate higher numbers of HPKs compared to existing tissue culture plastic (TCP) dishes. More importantly, this novel method was independent of feeder layer or any exogenous pharmaceutical drug. The HPKs from the hydrogel-substrate were functional as demonstrated by wound-healing assay, and the expression of IFN-γ-responsive genes (CXCL10, HLADR). Importantly, gene delivery efficiency by a lentiviral based delivery system was significantly higher in HPKs cultured on hydrogels compared with TCP. In conclusion, our study provides the first evidence that cell-material mechanical interaction is enough to provide a rapid expansion of functional keratinocytes that might be used as autologous grafts for skin disorders.},

	abstract = {The failure of chemotherapeutic drugs in treatment of various cancers is attributed to the acquisition of drug resistance. However, the migration mechanisms of drug-resistant cancer cells remain incompletely understood. Here we address this question from a biophysical perspective by mapping the phenotypic alterations in ovarian cancer cells (OCCs) resistant to cisplatin and paclitaxel. We show that cisplatin-resistant (CisR), paclitaxel-resistant (PacR) and dual drug-resistant (i.e., resistant to both drugs) OCCs are more contractile and softer than drug-sensitive cells. Protease inhibition suppresses invasion of CisR cells but not of PacR cells, indicative of a protease-dependent mode of migration in CisR cells and a protease-independent mode of migration in PacR. Despite these differences, actomyosin contractility, mediated by the RhoA-ROCK2-Myosin II signaling pathway, regulates both modes of migration. Confined migration experiments establish the role of myosin IIA and IIB in mediating nuclear translocation and regulation of proteolytic activity. Collectively, our results highlight the importance of myosin II as a potential therapeutic target for treatment of drug-resistant ovarian cancer cells.},

	abstract = {Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs), during in vitro expansion, gradually lose their distinct spindle morphology, self-renewal ability, multi-lineage differentiation potential and enter replicative senescence. This loss of cellular function is a major roadblock for clinical applications which demand cells in large numbers. Here, we demonstrate a novel role of substrate stiffness in the maintenance of hMSCs over long-term expansion. When serially passaged for 45 days from passage 3 to passage 18 on polyacrylamide gel of Young’s modulus E=5 kPa, hMSCs maintained their proliferation rate and showed nine times higher population doubling in comparison to their counterparts cultured on plastic Petri-plates. They did not express markers of senescence, maintained their morphology and other mechanical properties such as cell stiffness and cellular traction, and were significantly superior in adipogenic differentiation potential. These results were demonstrated in hMSCs from two different sources, umbilical cord and bone marrow. In summary, our result shows that a soft gel is a suitable substrate to maintain the stemness of mesenchymal stem cells. As preparation of polyacrylamide gel is a well-established, and well-standardized protocol, we propose that this novel system of cell expansion will be useful in therapeutic and research applications of hMSCs.},

However, crosstalk between the physical and chemical cues remains incompletely understood.Here,we address this question by probing the efficiency of epidermal growth factor (EGF)- induced hMSCchemotaxis on substrates of varying stiffness (3, 30 and 600 kPa) inside a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microfluidic device. Chemotactic speed was found to be the sum of a stiffness-dependent component and a chemokine concentration-dependent component. While the stiffness-dependent component scaled inversely with stiffness, the chemotactic component was independent of stiffness. Faster chemotaxis on the softest 3 kPa substrates is attributed to a combination of weaker adhesions and higher protrusion rate. While chemotaxis was mildly sensitive to contractility inhibitors, suppression of chemotaxis upon actin depolymerization demonstrates the role of actin-mediated protrusions in driving chemotaxis. In addition to highlighting the collective influence of physical and chemical cues in chemotactic migration, our results suggest that hMSC homing is more efficient on softer substrates.},

	abstract = {Nociceptor sensory neurons play a key role in eliciting pain. An active crosstalk between nociceptor neurons and the vascular system at the molecular and cellular level is required to sense and respond to noxious stimuli. Besides nociception, interaction between nociceptor neurons and vasculature also contributes to neurogenesis and angiogenesis. In vitro models of innervated vasculature can greatly help delineate these roles while facilitating disease modeling and drug screening. Herein, we report the development of a microfluidic-assisted tissue model of nociception in the presence of microvasculature. The self-assembled innervated microvasculature was engineered using endothelial cells and primary dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. The sensory neurons and the endothelial cells displayed distinct morphologies in presence of each other. The neurons exhibited an elevated response to capsaicin in the presence of vasculature. Concomitantly, increased transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) receptor expression was observed in the DRG neurons in presence of vascularization. Finally, we demonstrated the applicability of this platform for modeling nociception associated with tissue acidosis. While not demonstrated here, this platform could also serve as a tool to study pain resulting from vascular disorders while also paving the way towards the development of innervated microphysiological models.},

They are known to influence the behavior of resident stem cells. It is also known that ECM type and coating density on cell culture plates strongly influence in vitro cellular behavior. However, the influence of ECM protein coating on long-term mesenchymal stem cell expansion has not been studied yet. To address this gap, we cultured bone-marrow derived hMSCs for multiple passages on the tissue culture plastic plates coated with 25 μg/ml of various ECM proteins. We found that cells on plates coated with ECM proteins had much higher proliferation compared to the regular tissue culture plates. Further, gelatin-coated plates helped the cells to grow faster compared to collagen, fibronectin, and laminin coated plates. Additionally, the use of gelatin showed less size heterogeneity among the cells when expanded from passages 3 to 9 (P3 to P9). Gelatin also helped in maintaining cellular stiffness which was not observed across other ECM proteins. In summary, in this research, we have shown that gelatin which is the least expensive compared to other ECM proteins, provides a better platform for mesenchymal stem cell expansion.},

Engineering of these microvascular networks generally involves the use of endothelial cells stabilized by fibroblasts to generate robust and stable vasculature. However, fibroblasts are highly heterogenous and may contribute variably to the microvascular structure. Here, we study the effect of normal and cancer-associated lung fibroblasts on the formation and function of perfusable microvascular networks. We examine the influence of cancer-associated fibroblasts on microvascular networks when cultured in direct (juxtacrine) and indirect (paracrine) contacts with endothelial cells, discovering a generative inhibition of microvasculature in juxtacrine co-cultures and a functional inhibition in paracrine co-cultures. Furthermore, we probed the secreted factors differential between cancer-associated fibroblasts and normal human lung fibroblasts, identifying several cytokines putatively influencing the resulting microvasculature morphology and functionality. These findings suggest the potential contribution of cancer-associated fibroblasts in aberrant microvasculature associated with tumors and the plausible application of such in vitro platforms in identifying new therapeutic targets and/or agents that can prevent formation of aberrant vascular structures.},
